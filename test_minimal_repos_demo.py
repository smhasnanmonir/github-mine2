üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Users with minimal repositories (especially those with only forked repos) 
were being filtered out during repository mining.

üîç ROOT CAUSE:
In the analyze_commit_activity() method, the code was filtering repositories:

    # Filter out forks and get only user's original repos
    original_repos = [repo for repo in repos if not repo.fork]

If a user only had forked repositories, original_repos would be empty,
and the function would continue with no data collection.

‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. ADDED CHECK FOR EMPTY REPOSITORIES:
   After filtering, we now check if original_repos is empty and return
   valid data structure even for users with no original repos:

    # If user has no original repositories, still return valid structure with their basic info
    if not original_repos:
        logging.info(f"User {username} has no original repositories (only forks or no repos), returning basic activity data")
        activity_data['active_days'] = list(activity_data['active_days'])
        return activity_data

2. IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING:
   Enhanced collect_single_user() method with try-catch blocks around
   each analysis component, ensuring that even if one component fails,
   basic user data is still collected:

    # Basic user data - always collect this
    user_data = {
        'username': username,
        'followers': user.followers,
        'following': user.following,
        'public_repos': user.public_repos,
        'created_at': user.created_at,
        'updated_at': user.updated_at,
    }

    # Each analysis wrapped in try-catch
    try:
        user_data['extended_user_data'] = self.collect_extended_user_data(username)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.warning(f"Failed to collect extended data for {username}: {e}")
        user_data['extended_user_data'] = {}

3. BETTER LOGGING:
   Added comprehensive logging to track which users are being processed:

    logging.info(f"Starting data collection for user: {username}")
    logging.info(f"User {username}: {user.public_repos} public repos, {user.followers} followers")

üìä RESULTS:

‚úÖ Users with NO original repositories (only forks) - NOW FETCHED
‚úÖ Users with 1 repository - NOW FETCHED  
‚úÖ Users with minimal activity - NOW FETCHED
‚úÖ Users where some analysis fails - BASIC DATA STILL COLLECTED
‚úÖ All contributors in repository mining - NOW INCLUDED

üéØ EXAMPLE SCENARIOS NOW HANDLED:

1. User with only forked repositories:
   - Before: Skipped entirely
   - After: Basic profile data + social network + empty commit activity

2. User with 1 small repository:
   - Before: Might be skipped if analysis failed
   - After: All possible data collected with fallbacks

3. User with minimal commits:
   - Before: Might return empty results
   - After: Returns valid structure with counts even if 0

4. Repository contributor mining:
   - Before: Some contributors missing from results
   - After: ALL contributors included in final dataset

üí° USAGE:

When mining repository contributors, you'll now get data for ALL contributors:

    results = miner.mine_repository_contributors(
        repo_url='https://github.com/owner/repo',
        save_immediately=True,
        filename='complete_contributors',
        fetch_all_commits=False
    )
    
    # Results will include contributors with minimal repos too!

üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS:

The key change ensures that the data collection pipeline is robust:
- Collect basic user data FIRST (always succeeds)
- Try each analysis component independently
- Return valid data structure even on partial failures
- Include users regardless of repository count or type

This means your repository mining will now capture the complete picture
of all contributors, not just those with substantial original repositories.
