✅ NEW FEATURE ADDED: All Commits Option in GUI

🖥️  PROFILE MINING TAB:
• Added checkbox: "Count ALL commits (stores max 50 recent commit details)"
• When checked: Counts all-time commits but stores max 50 recent commit details
• When unchecked: Analyzes commits from last 30 days only
• Displays detailed commit statistics in success message

🖥️  REPOSITORY MINING TAB:
• Added checkbox: "Count ALL commits for each contributor (stores max 50 recent commit details)"
• When checked: Counts all-time commits for each contributor
• When unchecked: Analyzes commits from last 30 days only per contributor
• Shows aggregated statistics across all contributors

💡 MEMORY EFFICIENT DESIGN:
• Even with "all commits" checked, only stores max 50 recent commit details
• Counts total commits but doesn't store all commit data
• Perfect balance between comprehensive analysis and memory efficiency

🎯 HOW TO USE:

1. PROFILE MINING:
   - Enter GitHub token and profile URL
   - Check "Count ALL commits" for comprehensive analysis
   - Click "Mine Profile"
   - View detailed commit statistics in results

2. REPOSITORY MINING:
   - Enter GitHub token and repository URL
   - Check "Count ALL commits for each contributor" for comprehensive analysis
   - Click "Mine Contributors"
   - View aggregated statistics across all contributors

📊 EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Profile Mining with All Commits:
• All-time commits: 1,250
• Recent commits: 45
• Commit details stored: 45

Repository Mining with All Commits:
• Contributors processed: 12
• Total all-time commits: 8,500
• Total recent commits: 325
• Commit details stored: 325

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Added checkbox variables:
   - self.profile_all_commits_var (Profile tab)
   - self.repo_all_commits_var (Repository tab)

2. Updated mining methods:
   - mine_profile() now uses fetch_all_commits parameter
   - mine_repository() now uses fetch_all_commits parameter

3. Enhanced status messages:
   - Shows commit analysis mode being used
   - Displays detailed statistics upon completion
   - Clear explanation of what data is being stored

4. User-friendly help text:
   - Explains the difference between recent and all commits modes
   - Clarifies the 50 commit details storage limit
